    Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast,
     has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline. It's known for its 
     palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network
      of canals. Inland are the Western Ghats, mountains 
      whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations 
      as well as wildlife. National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar,
       plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, 
       langur monkeys and tigers.

       our country is Kerala. Kerala is
